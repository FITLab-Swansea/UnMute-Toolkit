* Community Engaged ASR Development Toolkit

The Community Engaged ASR Development Toolkit is a bespoke set of tools and methods to engage community members and collect spoken language recordings ([[https://github.com/treitmaier/SpeechBox][SpeechBox]]) and then community-source manual transcripts of the audio ([[https://github.com/treitmaier/TranscriptTool][TranscriptTool]]) .


The system's hardware designs, speech appliance code, API servers and Android app are all released under the Apache 2.0 license.
